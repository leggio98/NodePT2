design patterns describe repeatable ways
of writing code
they're reusable solutions to common
code design problems and each design
pattern solves a different problem an
influential book about design patterns
is design patterns the elements of
reusable object-oriented software it was
published in 1994 by a group of authors
known as the gang of four
the book describes 23 design patterns
and they fall into three different
categories
creational structural and behavioral
creational patterns focus on the
creation of objects
whereas structural patterns focus on
class and object composition
behavioral patterns focus on
communication between objects
each programming language has different
ways of implementing established design
patterns in this unit we're going to
learn how to apply the singleton adapter
decorator and dependency injector
patterns in our node.js applications
