in this lesson we're going to create a
web page that contains an html form
this is the form that we'll use to
upload photos of our planets
let's create a new web page
and we'll call it upload.html
and inside of that we'll create
our html tags
and we'll then add in our body tags
and now we're going to actually add a
form to our web page so
every form should have an action and
this is where we're going to be sending
the form data to so
we'll put in our api and we're going to
specify
a new
route that we haven't yet created
so this form will send
the contents of this form
will be submitted to our api to this
planet and then a planner id and then
photo
and now we're going to actually specify
the method
for this form is post so this will be a
post request that the browser makes when
we submit this form
and now we need to set the encoding type
and this is the content type effectively
of the request that's going to be made
and this is because we are sending
through
a form
that contains a file
and so when a form contains file data
this is the content type that we need to
use so this multi-part form data
and now inside of our form we're going
to add an input of type equals file
and this then
we'll give it a name
and we'll call it photo
and then we also want to add a button so
that we can submit this form so we'll
add an input with type
submit
so this is a complete form that has a
file input and has a button for
submitting and when this form is
submitted it will send the contents of
this form to this url here on our api
using the post http method
and so we can save that and let's make
sure we've actually got a valid id here
so we'll open up our terminal
and then we'll npm run dev
and then over in our browser let's open
up localhost
port 3000
planets
and then we can see what planets we've
got on our database right now so we've
got
planet
3 is mercury so we'll grab the id
and we'll use that here in our url
and so we've got that ready to go and
now we're going to actually
just go and run
mpm run web in a new terminal here
and then serve up our web pages so now
if we control click to open that in our
browser we can see we've got this upload
page
and that's here with that file input so
this is the file input that we created
here photo file input and then that
submit button so that's what's showing
here on the page
so we're going to say browse
and
then we can go and upload a test file so
we can
for example go and add this picture here
and submit that
but now we get this response cannot post
to planets three photos so that url
doesn't exist our api doesn't have that
root at the moment
so we will need to be creating that api
route in the next lesson
let's go ahead and commit the web page
that we've created we can close a couple
of things here
and stop our server
running
so we'll run git status and
then get out all of that
and then git commit
add
webpage to upload
planet photo
and then we can push that all up to
github
we've just created a webpage with an
html form that's ready for us to upload
planet photos
