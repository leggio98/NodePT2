PRISMA IS  a node.js and typescript orm
this means it can actually work with different types of database systems as others (mysql, sqlserver, sqllite and mongodb)

ther all are supported by prisma


let's first install the prisma client
and so we'll copy that package name and in vsc terminal type
npm install and we're going to install that package

npm install @prisma/client

we're also gonna install prisma cli which is gonna help us as we eork
with prisma and as we use different features

npm install --save-dev prisma

now that cli is installed qe can
npx prisma init
to run it

automatically we gonna have a prisma dirrectory created

with schema.prisma

here we gonna configure anything we need for our prisma setup , telling our
prisma how to connect with our database
and later we'l be adding new info
we now have the default setup to use postgres
ad we have the url where it's acutally require environment variable

we now in our .env file
can se the edited file by prisma, we can delete the comments and
look at what has been put in that file:
we're going to be connected with postgres
and we can change te username jon doe with our development username putting our
password afterit and set the port postgres database server is listening on
our database called space_facts and we can leave schema=public
to have DATABASE_URL="postgresql://AndreaBarberio:password@localhost:3000/space_facts?schema=public

CRETE A PRISMA MODEL

this will allow us to write and read datas from our db
in node.js

let's open up our prisma in prisma directory

let's define a model, let's call it planet  and inside of that we're going to specify the fields we want this particular
model to have


model Planet {
id                     Int     @id
}
through id and Int(stands for integer, is gonna be a number)
ther has to be some space

so every planet will have its own id
and we going to specify we want to be as an id field
adding specific syntax for prisma adding @ before the id
saying by @default(autoincrement) that its default value is that

so now when we add a new plaet its id is not gonna stay the same and automatically grow

let's add another field name  with its characteristics
setting its characters max length byy using @db.VarChar(255)
let's add one another field like description to see
optionals, set wit ? question mark  so that is optional and by default will be null
let's put the diamater field to store these values info'same

adding createdAt we will have a field which shows us when that field has been created allowing prisma to automatically set that value

this is a way we describe the fields that we want our planets model to have also in a way
prisma can use and create table inside of our dband the tables are where actually data get stored
so to map data model we've created to the database schema like to actually create something in our database we need to use prisma cli

let's open up the terminal

run

npx prisma migrate dev(cause we're on development environment this on) --name init

running this we are gonna create migration
this is WHEN WE WANT TO CHANGE SMTH IN THE DATABASE  from one state to another
in this case we're gonna be adding a model table
