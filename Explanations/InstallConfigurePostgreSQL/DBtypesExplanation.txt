DATABASE TYPES 
Databases are special kind of files, they're organised in specific ways to store Databases
for example 
with our spacefax api  we wanto to store data about planets 
that might be its name, diamater... saving these dates in the database 
database are managed by database management systems
they manage database files and provide ways for us to access the data that tey contain 
there two maintypes of database's system 
relational databases and NOsql databases 
REKLATIONAL DATABASES 
these are the oens that have named databases in this case we're accessing the space facts database 
the data is organized in the same side of these tables 
we can store inside of these tables
we can access the data using a querying language called sql 
which stands for language query language 
we can use to retrieve and manipulate database in the database tables 

to build a database we might use relational database management systems 
like 
mySQL, postgreSQL, sql server, sqlite
they work in the same way, they: 
-organize data with databases, tables 
inside of those tables you find :
-columns and then rows of data inside of them 
and they all allow us to use SQL to query them 

NOSQL databases
there are many different types of nosql databases 
generally they don't store data with a fixed structure, like relational ones 
MongoDB is a popular NOSQL database server, it works like: 
it looks like we're inside a spaceflax database so we've still got that concept of that database 
but inside of that we have collections 

here we look at the planets collection and inside of these collections we have documents so the datas we see under "mercury"
are separated documents, and they actually store all tthe data,
 organised as key value pairs so we have the key value name and the value mercury

 now these are different as sql databases, where everything is structured inside of a table and those have columns for specific data types,
here we can put any data we want inside of the documents we store in the collections 

to store and retrieve data in mongoDB we write queries in js so if we open the mongoShell
we can see that is some javascript db.planets.find() it's going to call this find method and when we run that we actually get 
back these documents 

apache cassandra neo4j redis are popular as noSQL databases these noaa skill database systems each work in different ways
