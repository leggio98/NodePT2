Create Api Route that can retrieve individual planet from our db 

We can run our test in watch mode 
then let's create a new route that is going to respond to  a single planet 
we can copy the existing get planet describe block

paste it to the end of our document 
rename it o get planet adding the actual path to the url that is gonna look like 

"GET /planet/:id"

as it is a single planet we dpnt need the const to called planets but planet
